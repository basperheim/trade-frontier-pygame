# Trade Frontier

**Trade Frontier** is a Pygame demo where you travel between port cities, buy and sell goods, and try to build your fortune before your trading charter expires. Each city has its own quirks, biases, and travel costs. Markets fluctuate daily with trends, random events, and news headlines that shape prices.

Your goal: finish the charter with the highest **net worth** possible.
